He is sitting in Alice's lap beside the table where I am writing—a happy, healthy, perfect child.</p><p>Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world—the second John Clayton—and bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.</p><p>There—as though to give my prophecy the weight of his endorsement—he has grabbed my pen in his chubby fists and with his inkbegrimed little fingers has placed the seal of his tiny finger prints upon the page.</p><p>And there, on the margin of the page, were the partially blurred imprints of four wee fingers and the outer half of the thumb.</p><p>When D'Arnot had finished the diary the two men sat in silence for some minutes.</p></div> </div>
