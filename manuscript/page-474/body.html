"If you are English why is it then that you cannot speak English?"</p><p>And then in a flash it came to him—the man was a mute, possibly a deaf mute.</p><p>So D'Arnot wrote a message on the bark, in English.</p><p>I am Paul d'Arnot, Lieutenant in the navy of France. I thank you for what you have done for me. You have saved my life, and all that I have is yours. May I ask how it is that one who writes English does not speak it?</p><p>Tarzan's reply filled D'Arnot with still greater wonder:</p><p>I speak only the language of my tribe—the great apes who were Kerchak's; and a little of the languages of Tantor, the elephant, and Numa, the lion, and of the other folks of the jungle I understand. With a human being I have never spoken, except once with Jane Porter, by signs. This is the first time I have spoken with another of my kind through written words.</p></div> </div>
