<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Adroitly D'Arnot led the conversation from point to point until the policeman had explained to the interested Tarzan many of the methods in vogue for apprehending and identifying criminals.</p><p>Not the least interesting to Tarzan was the part played by finger prints in this fascinating science.</p><p>"But of what value are these imprints," asked Tarzan, "when, after a few years the lines upon the fingers are entirely changed by the wearing out of the old tissue and the growth of new?"</p><p>"The lines never change," replied the official. "From infancy to senility the fingerprints of an individual change only in size, except as injuries alter the loops and whorls. But if imprints have been taken of the thumb and four fingers of both hands one must needs lose all entirely to escape identification."</p><p>"It is marvelous," exclaimed D'Arnot. "I wonder what the lines upon my own fingers may resemble."</p></div> </div>
